Overview
The Expenditure Data Analysis project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization on the expenditure dataset provided by NITI Aayog of India. The primary objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the expenditure data, visualize various aspects, and analyze state-wise spending patterns to predict future trends and aid in better decision-making.

Process
Data Extraction and Preparation:

Extracted the expenditure dataset from NITI Aayog.
Cleaned the dataset to remove inconsistencies and handle missing values.
Transformed the data into a suitable format for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform EDA.
Analyzed the expenditure data to understand distribution, trends, and patterns.
Identified key factors influencing expenditure across different states.
Data Visualization:

Created comprehensive visualizations to represent the expenditure data using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Highlighted insights through various charts, graphs, and plots.
Power BI Dashboard:

Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI Desktop.
Developed an interactive and insightful dashboard to visualize expenditure trends and patterns.
Published the dashboard on NovyPro for wider accessibility and engagement.
Outcome
The project provided valuable insights into the expenditure patterns across different states in India, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions. The interactive dashboard serves as a powerful tool for visualizing and predicting expenditure trends, facilitating better planning and resource allocation.
